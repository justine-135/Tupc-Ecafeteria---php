# My thoughts
Design is not quite good because i am still a beginner while developing this project. Code is not well organized but working. Overall, Developing this project is fun and very challenging specially working on the quantity function on each item. I am still continuing to learn and improve my hard skills in coding and in the future i might create a more organized, and well designed project compared to this.

Thank you!
